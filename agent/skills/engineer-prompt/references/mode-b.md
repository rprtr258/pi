# Mode B Reference

Loaded from SKILL.md when running Mode B:
required output format, ECC component matching tables, model recommendation,
multi-prompt splitting, and worked examples.

## Mode B Output Format

Present your analysis in this exact structure. Respond in the same language
as the user's input.

#### Section 1: Prompt Diagnosis

**Strengths:** List what the original prompt does well.

**Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Fix |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| (problem) | (consequence) | (how to fix) |

**Needs Clarification:** Numbered list of questions the user should answer.
If Phase 0 auto-detected the answer, state it instead of asking.

#### Section 2: Recommended ECC Components

| Type | Component | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Command | /plan | Plan architecture before coding |
| Skill | tdd | TDD methodology guidance |
| Agent | code-reviewer | Post-implementation review |
| Model | Sonnet 4.6 | Recommended for this scope |

#### Section 3: Optimized Prompt — Full Version

Present the complete optimized prompt inside a single fenced code block.
The prompt must be self-contained and ready to copy-paste. Include:
- Clear task description with context
- Tech stack (detected or specified)
- /command invocations at the right workflow stages
- Acceptance criteria
- Verification steps
- Scope boundaries (what NOT to do)

For items that reference blueprint, write: "Use the blueprint skill to..."
(not `/blueprint`, since blueprint is a skill, not a command).

#### Section 4: Optimized Prompt — Quick Version

A compact version for experienced ECC users. Vary by intent type:

| Intent | Quick Pattern |
|--------|--------------|
| New Feature | `/plan [feature]. /tdd to implement. /code-review. /verify.` |
| Bug Fix | `/tdd — write failing test for [bug]. Fix to green. /verify.` |
| Refactor | `/refactor-clean [scope]. /code-review. /verify.` |
| Research | `Use search-first skill for [topic]. /plan based on findings.` |
| Testing | `/tdd [module]. /e2e for critical flows. /test-coverage.` |
| Review | `/code-review. Then use security-reviewer agent.` |
| Docs | `/update-docs. /update-codemaps.` |
| EPIC | `Use blueprint skill for "[objective]". Execute phases with /verify gates.` |

#### Section 5: Enhancement Rationale

| Enhancement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| (what was added) | (why it matters) |

## Model Recommendation & Multi-Prompt Splitting

**Model recommendation** (include in output):

| Scope | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| TRIVIAL-LOW | Sonnet 4.6 | Fast, cost-efficient for simple tasks |
| MEDIUM | Sonnet 4.6 | Best coding model for standard work |
| HIGH | Sonnet 4.6 (main) + Opus 4.6 (planning) | Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation |
| EPIC | Opus 4.6 (blueprint) + Sonnet 4.6 (execution) | Deep reasoning for multi-session planning |

**Multi-prompt splitting** (for HIGH/EPIC scope):

For tasks that exceed a single session, split into sequential prompts:
- Prompt 1: Research + Plan (use search-first skill, then /plan)
- Prompt 2-N: Implement one phase per prompt (each ends with /verify)
- Final Prompt: Integration test + /code-review across all phases
- Use /save-session and /resume-session to preserve context between sessions

## Mode B Examples

**User input:**
```
Build a user login page
```

**Phase 0 detects:** `package.json` with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

**Optimized Prompt (Full):**
```
Implement a user login page using the project's existing tech stack
(Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS).

Tech requirements:
- Follow the project's existing component structure and routing conventions
- Form validation uses the validation approach already in the project
  (check whether Zod/Yup/other is in use first)
- Auth method: reuse the project's existing auth solution (if none, default to JWT)
- Include: email/password login form, form validation, error messages,
  loading states, responsive layout

Workflow:
1. /plan the component structure and auth flow first, referencing existing
   page patterns
2. /tdd test-first: write unit tests for the login form and integration
   tests for the auth flow
3. Implement the login page and auth logic
4. /code-review the implementation
5. /verify all tests pass and the page renders correctly

Security requirements:
- Never transmit passwords in plaintext
- Brute-force protection (rate limiting)
- XSS protection
- CSRF token

Acceptance criteria:
- All tests pass, 80%+ coverage
- Page renders correctly on mobile and desktop
- Successful login redirects to dashboard; failure shows an error message

Do not:
- Implement a registration page
- Implement forgot-password
- Modify the existing route structure
```

**User input:**
```
Add a REST API endpoint for user profile updates with validation
```

**Phase 0 detects:** `go.mod` with Go 1.22, Chi router

**Optimized Prompt (Full):**
```
Add a REST API endpoint for user profile updates (PATCH /api/users/:id).

Tech stack: Go 1.22 + Chi router (detected from project)

Requirements:
- PATCH /api/users/:id — partial update of user profile
- Input validation for fields: name, email, avatar_url, bio
- Auth: require valid token, users can only update own profile
- Return 200 with updated user on success
- Return 400 with validation errors on invalid input
- Return 401/403 for auth failures
- Follow existing API patterns in the codebase

Workflow:
1. /plan the endpoint structure, middleware chain, and validation logic
2. /tdd — write table-driven tests for success, validation failure, auth failure, not-found
3. Implement following existing handler patterns
4. /go-review
5. /verify — run full test suite, confirm no regressions

Do not:
- Modify existing endpoints
- Change the database schema (use existing user table)
- Add new dependencies without checking existing ones first (use search-first skill)
```

**User input:**
```
Migrate our monolith to microservices
```

**Optimized Prompt (Full):**
```
Use the blueprint skill to plan: "Migrate monolith to microservices architecture"

Before executing, answer these questions in the blueprint:
1. Which domain boundaries exist in the current monolith?
2. Which service should be extracted first (lowest coupling)?
3. Communication pattern: REST APIs, gRPC, or event-driven (Kafka/RabbitMQ)?
4. Database strategy: shared DB initially or database-per-service from start?
5. Deployment target: Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or serverless?

The blueprint should produce phases like:
- Phase 1: Identify service boundaries and create domain map
- Phase 2: Set up infrastructure (API gateway, service mesh, CI/CD per service)
- Phase 3: Extract first service (strangler fig pattern)
- Phase 4: Verify with integration tests, then extract next service
- Phase N: Decommission monolith

Each phase = 1 PR, with /verify gates between phases.
Use /save-session between phases. Use /resume-session to continue.
Use git worktrees for parallel service extraction when dependencies allow.

Recommended: Opus 4.6 for blueprint planning, Sonnet 4.6 for phase execution.
