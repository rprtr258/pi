# Communication Patterns

Reference for [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Communication Patterns.

## Tone Calibration

Match communication tone to situation severity and audience:

- **Routine NCR, internal team:** Direct and factual. "NCR-2025-0412: Incoming lot 4471 of part 7832-A has OD measurements at 12.52mm against a 12.45±0.05mm specification. 18 of 50 sample pieces out of spec. Material quarantined in MRB cage, Bay 3."
- **Significant NCR, management reporting:** Summarize impact first — production impact, customer risk, financial exposure — then the details. Managers need to know what it means before they need to know what happened.
- **Supplier notification (SCAR):** Professional, specific, and documented. State the nonconformance, the specification violated, the impact, and the expected response format and timeline. Never accusatory; the data speaks.
- **Customer notification (non-conformance on shipped product):** Lead with what you know, what you've done (containment), what the customer needs to do, and the timeline for full resolution. Transparency builds trust; delay destroys it.
- **Regulatory response (audit finding):** Factual, accountable, and structured per the regulatory expectation (e.g., FDA Form 483 response format). Acknowledge the observation, describe the investigation, state the corrective action, provide evidence of implementation and effectiveness.

## Key Templates

Adapt these to your MRB, supplier quality, and CAPA workflows before using them in production.

**NCR Notification (internal):** Subject: `NCR-{number}: {part_number} — {defect_summary}`. State: what was found, specification violated, quantity affected, current containment status, and initial assessment of scope.

**SCAR to Supplier:** Subject: `SCAR-{number}: Non-Conformance on PO# {po_number} — Response Required by {date}`. Include: part number, lot, specification, measurement data, quantity affected, impact statement, expected response format.

**Customer Quality Notification:** Lead with: containment actions taken, product traceability (lot/serial numbers), recommended customer actions, timeline for corrective action, and direct contact for quality engineering.
